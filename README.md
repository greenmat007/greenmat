Explanation of the dependencies:
numpy: Used for numerical operations, such as creating arrays and performing mathematical calculations.
scipy: Used for calculating entropy (from scipy.stats.entropy).
scikit-learn: Provides machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest), data preprocessing (e.g., train_test_split, StandardScaler), and metrics (e.g., accuracy_score).
tensorflow: Required for any deep learning model you might want to use later. Though we aren't directly using TensorFlow for this Random Forest-based example, it is often useful in a machine learning workflow.
Installation:
You can install the required packages by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the exact versions specified in the file, ensuring consistency across environments. Let me know if you need additional customization!
